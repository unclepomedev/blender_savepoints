**Don't just save your file. Save your journey.**

**SavePoints** transforms your standard file saving into a visual timeline. Browse your project's history with thumbnails, restore any state instantly, and now—**turn your progress into a timelapse video with a single click.**

## Why SavePoints?

- **📸 Visual Versioning**: Forget "final_v2_fix.blend". See exactly what each version looks like with automatic thumbnails.
- **🎬 Instant Timelapse (New!)**: Batch render your history using your **current camera angle**. Create stunning evolution videos of your work effortlessly.
- **⚡ Smart Shortcuts**: Choose between documentation and speed. Use shortcuts to save with a note, or force-save instantly (`Shift` added) to skip the dialog.
- **👻 Ghost Overlay**: Overlay a previous version as a wireframe in the viewport to compare changes instantly.
- **📦 Asset Rescue**: Need a model you deleted 3 hours ago? Append objects from any snapshot without opening the file.
- **🏷️ Smart Tags**: Mark versions as "Stable" or "Milestone" to keep your history organized.
- **🛡️ Safe & Clean**: Autosaves run in the background without cluttering your list. Restoring a version automatically backs up your current state—zero data loss.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **No GPU?**: Thumbnails are skipped in headless/no-GPU environments, but versioning remains fully functional.
- **Asset Browser Safety**: Snapshots are saved as `.blend_snapshot` to ensure **no duplicate assets appear in your Asset Browser**.
- **Auto-Save**: To prevent viewport lag, auto-save does not generate thumbnails.
